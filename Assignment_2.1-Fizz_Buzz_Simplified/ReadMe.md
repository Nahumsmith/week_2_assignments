## Assignment 2.1-Fizz Buzz Simplified
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------


Write a short program that prints (using console.log) that:

For a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

For a multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

For a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

You will be graded on the number of lines of code you have (the fewer lines, the better).

Do not look up the solution online.
