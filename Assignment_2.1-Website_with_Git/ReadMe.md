# Workshop: Website with Git


## Part One: git commands

Type out a step-by-step for which git commands you have to type out to start a project and to make commits.

## Part Two: Website w/ Git

Build a very basic web page. As you go, make commits at the following points:

- After you put in the basic HTML scaffolding (`<DOCTYPE html>` to `</html>`)
- After you add some body content
- When you add a stylesheet with some styles
- After you add a navigation bar
- When your project is complete

## Grading Criteria

We're grading students on their understanding of git here so you can basically ignore the website itself. Be sure that the student has at least 3 commits in their project (they should have 5 or 6!) and they've written out all git commands correctly.
